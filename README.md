### Use a Framework/Library:
Consider using a framework or library to handle common tasks. Some popular choices are:

Web Framework: Gin or Echo
Database ORM: GORM or pgx
### Structure Your Code:
Follow a directory structure that logically separates your code:

/models: Database model definitions and DB-related operations.
/handlers or /controllers: HTTP handlers for various endpoints.
/middleware: Middlewares for tasks like authentication, logging, etc.
/config: Configuration related code.
/utils or /helpers: Miscellaneous utility functions.
### Use Environment Variables for Configuration:
Instead of hardcoding database credentials, use environment variables. This makes your application more portable and secure.

### Connection Pooling:
When connecting to a PostgreSQL database, make sure to use connection pooling. This optimizes the number of open connections and reuses existing connections, improving efficiency.

### Error Handling:
Properly handle database and other errors, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

### Middleware for Common Tasks:
Use middleware for:

Logging: Log every request and response.
Authentication: Protect certain routes.
CORS: If your API is being accessed from web browsers.
### Use Prepared Statements:
To avoid SQL injection attacks, use prepared statements.

### Use Transactions:
When performing multiple related operations, use database transactions to ensure data integrity.

### Test Your Code:
Write unit and integration tests. Consider using libraries like Testify.

### Documentation:
Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger so others know how to interact with your service.
